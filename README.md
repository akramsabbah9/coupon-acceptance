# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

This is an analysis of a dataset collected by UC Irvine in which various drivers were asked whether they would accept a given coupon in various situations. The goal of this project is to determine the various factors behind whether a person would accept the coupon issued in a given scenario.

## Findings

After carefully studying the data, it was concluded that drivers were more likely to accept the coupon given the following factors:

* They tended to already use the service which was being advertized by the coupon.

* They were either on the way home or had no urgent destination.

* The conditions were sunny on the day the coupon was issued.

* The coupon was issued near lunch or dinner.

* They worked in an occupation which restricted their free time.

## Conclusion

The above findings demonstrate that targeting coupons towards different demographics of drivers would increase coupon acceptance.

For example, issuing bar coupons mainly to drivers which *already* frequent bars at least semi-regularly would drastically improve the acceptance rate. Likewise, issuing more takeout coupons towards high school students, who tend to have less disposable income than adults, would also prove effective.

Coupons should also be issued during peak service and meal hours, such as in the afternoon and evening, and on days when the weather is temperate. This incentivizes drivers to act on the coupon, as opposed to ignoring it in favor of driving to their intended destination.
